### Goncy proposed an advent challenge for 25 days, so here I am, practicing React, Next, TypeScript and Tailwindcss.

### The idea is build a chritsmas app to make a present's list 🎁

## Day 1:

Just write a list of gifts 🎁

## Day 2:

Add some color! Could be background, chritmas typography, text colors... Wherever to make the app look more chritsmas 🎅

## Day 3:

We need a form to add a lot of gifts... It's a generous time 🎁🎁

## Day 4:

Just in case the gift is sold out, let's add a button to delete it.

## Day 5:

Or maybe all gifts on the list are sold out 😞😫 To not delete one by one, let's add another button but to delete all.

## Day 6:

The list is empty now and there's a lot of white space, with a short message the app looks a bit better.

## Day 7:

The list can have black spaces? That's not a gift! Let's change that.

## Day 8:

The washing machine ate a lot of socks this year (ok, no machine... just 🐶), so the list needs a counter to remember how many we give away.

## Day 9:

When the page is refreshed the list is gone 😫 we don't want that! We need to save it on some place, so we can always have the list. I saved it on localStorage.

## Day 10:

Let's add the url of the image, so we can know exactly what gift is.

## Day 11:

There's a lot of things in the list now, it will be better if we split the form from the list with a modal.

## Day 12:

What if we will used this app to Secret Santa? We will need to write our name, right? Let's add an input for it!

## Day 13:

Just in case we write the name of the gift like it sounds, now we need to edit it.

## Day 14:

Not all of us have the same abilities, so let's make the app usable by people with disabilities 💝
